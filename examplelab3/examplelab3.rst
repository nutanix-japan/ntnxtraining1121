Creating an Unmanaged Client Network
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this exercise you will create an unmanaged network.

#. Log on to your clusterâ€™s Prism UI (Element) as the **admin** user.

#. Click the **gear** icon, scroll down in **Settings** to the **Network** section and click **Network Configuration**.

#. Click **Virtual Networks** if not already selected.

#. Click **Save** to create the network.

Managing Open vSwitch (OVS)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this exercise you will explore a few commands to manage Open vSwitch (OVS) from the CVM and use those commands to build an additional virtual switch.

#. Using PuTTY, establish an SSH connection to one of your CVMs and log on with the **nutanix** user and password **(Refer to Cluster Configuration Guide)**.

#. Use **allssh** to execute commands on all CVMs. To view network interface information, type the command:

   .. code-block:: bash

     allssh manage_ovs show_interfaces

   * How many network interfaces are on each node?
   * How many network interfaces are 10GbE?
   * How many network interfaces are 1GbE?

#. To list existing bridges for each Nutanix node in the cluster, type the command:

   .. code-block:: bash

     allssh manage_ovs show_bridges

   * How many bridges are on each node?

#. To show bridge uplinks for each Nutanix node in the cluster, type the command:

   .. code-block:: bash

    allssh manage_ovs show_uplinks

   * Which network interfaces are on bond (or port) br0-up?
