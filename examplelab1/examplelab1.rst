Using nCLI
+++++++++++

In this exercise you will learn the Nutanix Command Line Interface (nCLI):

•	Basic Commands and Getting Help

•	Extracting Information

•	Use nCLI to Build a Storage Container


Accessing nCLI and Using Basic Commands
........................................

In this task you will access the nCLI shell and perform basic commands.


1.	In the PuTTY Host Name (or IP address) field, type the IP Address of the any CVM from your Cluster General Information site. (Refer to Cluster Configuration Guide for the credentials detail.)


2.	From the command prompt, type ncli to enter the nCLI shell.
 
 .. figure:: images/12.png


3.	Type help or hit the **tab** key twice to view all possible commands from within the nCLI.

4.	To display help for the datastore entity, type the command: 
 
.. code-block:: putty

   <ncli> datastore help


5.	To get help on the container entity, type the command:

.. code-block:: putty

   <ncli> container help

   What command do you enter to get nCLI help for user accounts? 

   What command do you enter to list user accounts?

 
Extracting Information
...............................


In this task you will use the nCLI shell to answer the following questions.


1.	Type storagepool list. How many storage pools does the cluster have? 

2.	Type the command that lists all the storage containers in the cluster. How many storage containers does the cluster have? 

3.	Refer to the storage container named **default-container-#####** and answer the following questions:

   How much free space is available in the storage container?

   How much space has been used in the storage container?

   What is the compression setting?


4.	Find and use the command to list all virtual machines in the cluster. How many virtual machines are there in the cluster? Does this include or exclude CVMs?

5.	Type cluster info to display cluster information. Answer the following questions:
What AOS software version is running on the cluster? (Compare the output from the cluster version command.)
   
  How many nodes and blocks are in the cluster?

  What is the cluster time zone?


6.	Type **exit** to leave the **nCLI** shell and return to the **Bash** shell.

7.	You can combine Bash shell commands and nCLI commands to filter and format nCLI output. For example, to count the number of SSDs in the cluster, type the command:

.. code-block:: ncli

  ncli disk list | grep SSD | wc -l 
	
.. Note::

   The final character in the above command is the letter “l” (lowercase “L”).

  
 How many SSDs are in the cluster?
 How many HDDs are in the cluster?

8.	In the Prism UI, confirm your findings by switching to the Hardware dashboard, clicking the Table tab, then clicking the Disk button. Review the Tier column to confirm.


Using nCLI to Build a Storage Container
.................................................


In this task you will create and delete a storage container using nCLI.


1.	In your PuTTY connection to one of your CVMs, type ncli to enter the nCLI shell.

2.	To get help with the container create command, type:

.. code-block:: ncli

  <ncli> container create help


3.	The name of the storage pool is a required argument to the container create command. Get the unique name of the default storage pool by typing the following command:


.. code-block:: ncli

  <ncli> storagepool list


4.	Create a container named **cli-container-<lastname>** by typing the following command:

.. code-block:: ncli

  <ncli> container create name=cli-lastname sp-name=default-storage-pool-#####

.. Note::  

  Where ##### is the cluster ID based on what you discovered in the previous step. <lastname> is your surname.


5.	From the Prism UI, click the **Dashboard** menu and go to **Storage > Table > Storage Container** to confirm the container is created.

6.	Click to select **cli-container-<lastname>**. 

7.	Immediately below the table of containers and at the far right, click **Delete**. In the confirmation dialog box, click **Delete** to confirm the action.

8.	Verify that **cli-container-<lastname>** has been deleted.

9.	Return to your SSH (PuTTY terminal) session.

10.	Verify that your container has been deleted:

  .. code-block:: ncli

     <ncli> container list
